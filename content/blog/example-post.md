# Welcome to AI Blogger

This is an example blog post. You can delete this file and add your own markdown files to the `content/blog/` folder.

## How it works

1. Add any `.md` file to the `content/blog/` folder
2. Include frontmatter with `title`, `date`, and optionally `description`
3. Commit and push to your repository
4. Your site will automatically rebuild and deploy!

## Frontmatter format

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "Optional description"
date: 2024-01-15
draft: false  # Set to true to hide in production
---
```

Then write your markdown content below the frontmatter.
